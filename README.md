# Pet Image Classifier

This program uses three CNN architectures (AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG) to classify images into categories, specifically dogs, their breeds, and not-dogs. By comparing their results, one can see that VGG appears to be the most capable architecture in this capacity with 100% accuracy in classifying the 'dog' and 'not-dog' categories, the highest rate of breed matching, and the ability to classify breeds correctly from inverted images.

This program was built on a foundation provided by Udacity [here](https://github.com/udacity/AIPND-revision).
